# Welcome to Atlas

## Introduction

Powered by [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/). At its core, Plex is designed to be your all-in-one media hub - the last place youâ€™ll ever need to go for your entertainment.

Beyond its powerful media server, Plex also offers its own services you may enjoy, including free on-demand content, live TV (with ads), and even movie rentals.  

What makes Plex especially unique is the ability to stream content I personally own, all through their secure client. This allows me to share a completely free media library with you, powered by a technology called [torrenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent){:target="_blank" .btn}.
