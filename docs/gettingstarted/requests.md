# Requesting Media

Overseerr is the interface for requesting media. It allows media discovery and provides info on your requests. It's use is optional and you can decide to just watch media already on the server if you please.

**How to use Overseerr:**

1. Open: [search.serveratlas.online](https://search.serveratlas.online){:target="_blank" .btn}  

2. Sign in with your Plex account (the same account you used for Plex).

3. Search for a title. click **Request**. Discovery does not coincide with actual availability.

4. After requesting, view request details to see status, ETA estimates, and logs.

**Typical timing:**

- Many requests complete in a few hours; some are available within an hour. Other requests (obscure or poorly seeded content) may take days or never complete without manual assistance.
