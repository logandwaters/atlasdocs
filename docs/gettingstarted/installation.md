## Plex Web App

While an offical Plex app exists for almost all devices, the client is also avaliable via most modern web browsers.

!!! warning

    The web client should be used primarily for temporary access or testing. Using the offical app is the highly recommended experience on all devices.

    ??? info "Note"

        Browser access is not optimized and can put x5 - x10 more strain on the server than access from a Plex client. Accessing from a Plex client can help free up resources for everyone using the service.
