You can access the server and watch media from any official Plex client.

!!! warning

    The web client should be used primarily for temporary access or testing. Using the offical app is the highly recommended experience on all devices.

    ??? info "Note"

        Browser access is not optimized and can put x5 - x10 more strain on the server than access from a Plex client. Accessing from a Plex client can help free up resources for everyone using the service.

**Notes & tips:**

- If you prefer not to install or encounter issues, the Plex Web App works in most modern browsers.
 
- If playback fails on one device, try another (mobile or web) to confirm whether the issue is deviceâ€‘specific.
