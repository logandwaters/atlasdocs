# Service Expectations

Due to the nature of this system some issues are inherretly unavoidable. Below, read about what you can expect and how to take action on issues.

**Caveats with requests:** Some titles will never be available because they are too new or have no reliable public sources. If your request is not fufilled automatically this is most likely the issue.

**Common quality issues:** Files from public public sources will sometimes have imperfections. Incorrect language tracks, missing subtitles, audio sync problems, visual artifacts, or brief time skips are some issues you might encounter.

**Troubleshooting issues:** If you encounter issues media specific issues as described above, submit a report within Plex or Overseer with a short decription of the issue. I will take action as soon as possible.

**Service interruptions:** Outages can occur due to power, internet, or hardware issues. I will restore service when possible, but I cannot guarantee uptime.
