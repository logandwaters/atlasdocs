# Navigation & How the Server Appears to You

This section explains where to find your content and how to use the primary features.

**Left navigation (most clients):**

- **Home:** mixes Plex’s Discover/Licensed content with your ad‑free libraries and continue watching suggestions.  
- **Movies / Shows:** these are the ad‑free libraries provided by Atlas. Use these to browse, filter, and play content.  
- **Discover / Live TV:** Plex’s free/ad‑supported content — available alongside the Atlas libraries.

**Useful actions:**

- **Search:** fastest way to locate a title.  
- **Watchlist:** save items for later.  
- **Pin favorites:** most apps allow pinning or favoriting sections or titles for quick access.

**Playback controls & language:**

- Use the player’s audio & subtitle menus to select alternate tracks. If a file has incorrect language or missing audio, try other tracks first.  
- Use quality controls in the player to lower bitrate if playback stutters.
