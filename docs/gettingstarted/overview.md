# Acknowledgement

This Plex instance is operated from a private, home server maintained as a hobby. Before proceeding, read the following carefully. This is important so you understand how the service is provided and what to expect.

**Key points:**

- Media may be obtained via publicly shared sources seeded by volunteers (often using torrent protocols). This enables free, ad‑free access but sits in an ethical gray area for some users. If you are uncomfortable, please do not proceed.  

- The service is community‑driven and hobbyist‑maintained. While it functions reliably most of the time, occasional downtimes, missing content, or media defects are possible.
