# Acknowledgement

This Plex instance is operated from a private, home server maintained as a hobby. Before proceeding, read the following carefully. This is important so you understand how the service is provided and what to expect.

**Key points:**

- Media may be obtained via publicly shared sources seeded by volunteers (often using torrent protocols). This enables free, ad‑free access but sits in an ethical gray area for some users. If you are uncomfortable, please do not proceed.  

- The service is community‑driven and hobbyist‑maintained. While it functions reliably most of the time, occasional downtimes, missing content, or media defects are possible.

# Requesting Media

Overseerr is the interface for requesting media. It allows media discovery and provides info on your requests. It's use is optional and you can decide to just watch media already on the server if you please.

**How to use Overseerr:**

1. Open: [search.serveratlas.online](https://search.serveratlas.online){:target="_blank" .btn}  

2. Sign in with your Plex account (the same account you used for Plex).

3. Search for a title. click **Request**. Discovery does not coincide with actual availability.

4. After requesting, view request details to see status, ETA estimates, and logs.

**Typical timing:**

- Many requests complete in a few hours; some are available within an hour. Other requests (obscure or poorly seeded content) may take days or never complete without manual assistance.

# Navigation & How the Server Appears to You

This section explains where to find your content and how to use the primary features.

**Left navigation (most clients):**

- **Movies / Shows:** these are the ad‑free libraries provided by Atlas. Use these to browse, filter, and play content.

- Use the player’s audio & subtitle menus to select alternate tracks. If a file has incorrect language or missing audio, try other tracks first.  
- Use quality controls in the player to lower bitrate if playback stutters.

# Service Expectations

Due to the nature of this system some issues are inherretly unavoidable. Below, read about what you can expect and how to take action on issues.

**Caveats with requests:** Some titles will never be available because they are too new or have no reliable public sources. If your request is not fufilled automatically this is most likely the issue.

**Common quality issues:** Files from public public sources will sometimes have imperfections. Incorrect language tracks, missing subtitles, audio sync problems, visual artifacts, or brief time skips are some issues you might encounter.

**Troubleshooting issues:** If you encounter issues media specific issues as described above, submit a report within Plex or Overseer with a short decription of the issue. I will take action as soon as possible.

**Service interruptions:** Outages can occur due to power, internet, or hardware issues. I will restore service when possible, but I cannot guarantee uptime.
